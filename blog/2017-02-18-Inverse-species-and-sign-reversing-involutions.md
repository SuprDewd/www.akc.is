# Inverse species and sign-reversing involutions

<div class="blog">

Given a finite set $U$ with $n$ element. Assuming $n$ is positive, how
would you prove that there are as many subsets of $S$ with even
cardinality as there are with odd cardinality? One way is to use the
binomial theorem:
$$
0^n = (1-1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n{n \choose k}(-1)^k
    = \sum_{\text{$k$ even}}{n \choose k} - \sum_{\text{$k$ odd}}{n \choose k}.
$$
That's neat, but not very combinatorial. For a more combinatorial proof
we can use a so called sign-reversing involution.

A function $f:X\to X$ is an *involution* if it is its own inverse, or,
in symbols, $f(f(x))=x$. Assume that a function $\epsilon:X\to\{-1,1\}$
is given. We refer to $\epsilon(x)$ as the *sign* of $x$. Now, $f$
is a *sign-reversing involution* if for each non fixed point $x$ in $X$
the sign of $x$ is reversed by $f$; that is,
$\epsilon(f(x))=-\epsilon(x)$. If $f$ is a sign-reversing involution of
$X$, then
$$\newcommand{Fix}{\mathrm{Fix}}
\sum_{x\in X}\epsilon(x) = \!\!\sum_{x\in \Fix(f)}\!\!\!\epsilon(x),
$$
where $\Fix(f)=\{x\in X: f(x)=x\}$ denotes the set of fixed points of
$f$.  This is because, under $f$, each negative non fixed point is
paired with a unique positive non fixed point, and vice versa. For
counting purposes we usually also require  that all fixed
points of $f$ have the same sign, and thus the right hand sum is
$\pm|\Fix(f)|$.

In the example of counting subsets of a nonempty set $U$ with respect to
parity, a natural sign function is defined by $\epsilon(S) =
(-1)^{|S|}$, for $S\subseteq U$. Assuming $U$ is equipped with a total
order and that $\hat 0$ denotes the smallest element of $U$, a sign
reversing involution is given by
$$
f(S) =
\begin{cases}
  S \setminus \{\hat 0\} & \text{if $\hat 0\in S$}, \\
  S \cup \{\hat 0\}      & \text{if $\hat 0\notin S $}.
\end{cases}
$$
For instance, if $U=\{1,2\}$ then $f(\emptyset)=\{1\}$,
$f(\{1\})=\emptyset$, $f(\{2\})=\{1,2\}$, and $f(\{1,2\})=\{2\}$. Note
that $f$ is fixed point free; thus $\Fix(f)=\emptyset$ and
$$
\#\{S : S\subseteq U, \text{$|S|$ even}\} -
\#\{S : S\subseteq U, \text{$|S|$ odd}\} = |\Fix(f)| = 0.
$$
Now, that's a simple and beautiful proof, but is this a proof from The
Book, as Paul Erd≈ës might have asked? Is there a more general and
"natural" combinatorial proof? E.g. do we have to assume a total order
on $U$ and do we have to mention special elements, such as $\hat 0$?
Before proceeding to the next paragraph you might want to take a moment
and try to come up with such a proof.

Let $E$ be the [combinatorial
species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_species) of sets,
defined by $E[U]=\{U\}$. Its exponential generating function is
$E(x)=e^x$, and its multiplicative inverse is the [virtual
species](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2017/02/10/virtual-species-suffice/)
$E^{-1}$ such that $E\cdot E^{-1}=1$, where $1[U]=\{U\}$ if $U=\emptyset$ and
$1[U]=\emptyset$ otherwise. Note that
$$
E^{-1} = (1+E_+)^{-1} = \sum_{k\geq 0} (-1)^k(E_+)^k,
$$
where $E_+$ denotes the species of nonempty sets. Thus, $E^{-1}$ is the
species of signed ballots (also called ordered set partitions), where the
sign of a ballot $B_1 B_2\dots B_k$ is $(-1)^k$; that is, the parity of
the number of blocks. For instance, $\{d\}\{a,c,e\}\{b\}$ is a ballot of
$U=\{a,b,c,d,e\}$ and its sign is $(-1)^3=-1$.

The species of subsets $\newcommand{\Pow}{\mathfrak{P}}\Pow$ is defined
by $\Pow[U]=\{(S,U\setminus S): S\subseteq U\}$. Note that
$$
(E \cdot E)[U]
   = \sum_{S\subseteq U} E[S] \times E[U\setminus S]
   = \sum_{S\subseteq U} \{S\} \times \{U\setminus S\}
   = \Pow[U].
$$
That is, $\Pow=E^2$ and its
exponential generating function is
$$
\Pow(x)=E(x)^2 = e^{2x}=\sum_{n\geq 0}2^n \frac{x^n}{n!}.
$$
Further, counting subsets with respect to the sign $(-1)^{|S|}$ we get
$$E(-x)E(x) = e^{-x}e^{x} = e^0 = 1.
$$
Thus, the species interpretation of there being as many subsets of
even cardinality as of odd cardinality is $E\cdot E^{-1}=1$.
So, a combinatorial proof of this can be given by a
sign-reversing involution demonstrating that $E\cdot E^{-1}=1$. The objects
of $E\cdot E^{-1}$ are pairs $(S, \beta)$ such that $S\subseteq U$ and
$\beta=B_1 B_2\dots B_k$ is a signed ballot of $U\setminus S$. For example,
$(E\cdot E^{-1})[\{a,b,c\}]$ consists of the pairs
$$
\begin{array}{c|c}
  \text{positive pairs} & \text{negative pairs} \\
  (\{a,b,c\}, \emptyset)    & (\emptyset,\{a,b,c\}) \\
  (\emptyset, \{a\}\{b,c\}) & (\{a\}, \{b,c\})      \\
  (\emptyset, \{b\}\{a,c\}) & (\{b\}, \{a,c\})      \\
  (\emptyset, \{c\}\{a,b\}) & (\{c\}, \{a,b\})      \\
  (\emptyset, \{a,b\}\{c\}) & (\{a,b\}, \{c\})      \\
  (\emptyset, \{a,c\}\{b\}) & (\{a,c\}, \{b\})      \\
  (\emptyset, \{b,c\}\{a\}) & (\{b,c\}, \{a\})      \\
  (\{a\}, \{b\}\{c\})       & (\emptyset, \{a\}\{b\}\{c\})  \\
  (\{a\}, \{c\}\{b\})       & (\emptyset, \{a\}\{c\}\{b\})  \\
  (\{b\}, \{a\}\{c\})       & (\emptyset, \{b\}\{a\}\{c\})  \\
  (\{b\}, \{c\}\{a\})       & (\emptyset, \{b\}\{c\}\{a\})  \\
  (\{c\}, \{a\}\{b\})       & (\emptyset, \{c\}\{a\}\{b\})  \\
  (\{c\}, \{b\}\{a\})       & (\emptyset, \{c\}\{b\}\{a\})  \\
\end{array}
$$
This suggest the natural sign-reversing involution
$$
f(S,B_1 B_2 \dots B_k) =
\begin{cases}
  (B_1, B_2 B_3 \dots B_k) &\text{if $S=\emptyset$,}\\
  (\emptyset, SB_1 B_2 \dots B_k) &\text{if $S\neq\emptyset$.}
\end{cases}
$$
The table above is arranged so that pairs on the same row are images of
each other under $f$.

More generally, if $F$ is a species such that $|F[\emptyset]|=1$ then
the multiplicative inverse, $F^{-1}$, is the virtual species of lists
$\alpha_1\alpha_2\dots\alpha_k$ of nonempty $F$-structures in which the sign
is $(-1)^k$.  A proof is given by the fixed point free sign-reversing
involution
$$
f(\alpha,\alpha_1 \alpha_2 \dots \alpha_k) =
\begin{cases}
  (\alpha_1, \alpha_2 \alpha_3 \dots \alpha_k)
    &\text{if $\alpha\in F[\emptyset]$,}\\
  (\emptyset, \alpha \alpha_1 \alpha_2 \dots \alpha_k)
    &\text{if $\alpha\notin F[\emptyset]$.}
\end{cases}
$$

For more examples of the use of sign-reversing involutions the reader
might want to have a look at my
[paper](http://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v21i4p16)
with Stuart Hannah.

Finally I'd like to thank my friend [Bjark](https://algo.is/) for
suggesting that I write this post.
